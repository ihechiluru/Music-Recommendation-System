Brief

In this task, we were asked to predict the chances of a user listening to a song repetitively after the first observable listening event within a time window was triggered. If there are recurring listening event(s) triggered within a month after the userâ€™s very first observable listening event, its target is marked 1, and 0 otherwise in the training set. The same rule applies to the testing set.

The train and the test data are selected from users listening history in a given time period. Note that this time period is chosen to be before the WSDM-KKBox Churn Prediction time period. The train and test sets are split based on time, and the split of public/private is based on unique user/song pairs.
